# Image Captioning

Pytorch code for Image captioning using ViT Encoder and the following Decoders:  (i) Vanilla LSTM, (ii) Attention LSTM, (iii) Bahdanau Attention LSTM, and (iv) Transformers. (ii) and (iii) are used for explainablity

## Python Environment Setup

Ensure the following is installed in your python environment:

- Pytorch - required for standard nn llibraries and automatic backpropagation
- Torchvision - required for libraries related to computer vision
- Matploitlib - required for plotting
- Transformers (Huggingface): Required for Pretrained Vision Transformers
- NLTK - required for calculating BLEU score
